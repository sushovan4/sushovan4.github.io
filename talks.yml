  abstract: Topological reconstruction of a manifold from a sample around it is a challenging computational problem, with varied applications in topological data analysis and manifold learning. Manifold structures appear frequently and naturally in many fields of science. Examples include Euclidean surfaces, phase spaces of dynamical systems, configuration spaces of robots, etc. Inferring the homotopy type of an unknown manifold from a set of finite (often noisy) observations constitutes the finite reconstruction problem. Latschev in his remarkable paper established the existence of a sufficiently small scale for the Vietorisâ€“Rips complex of a dense sample to faithfully retain the topology of the manifold. The result is only qualitative, hence impractical for applications. We will discuss a recent development that provides the first quantitative result, along with a novel proof Latshev's theorem.

- title: "A Taste of Topological Data Analysis (TDA): Reconstruction of Shapes"
  date: 2022-01-20
  place: ICFAI, Tripura
  abstract: "Topological data analysis (TDA) is a growing field of study that
  helps address data analysis questions. TDA is deemed a better alternative to
  traditional statistical approaches when the data inherit a topological and
  geometric structure. Most of the modern technologies at our service rely on
  'geometric shapes' in some way or the other. Be it the Google Maps showing you
  the fastest route to your destination or the 3D printer on your desk creating
  an exact replica of a relic---shapes are being repeatedly sampled,
  reconstructed, and compared by intelligent machines. In this talk, we will
  catch a glimpse of how some of the famous topological concepts---like
  persistent homology, Vietoris-Rips and Cech complexes, Nerve Lemma, etc---lend
  themselves well to the reconstruction of shapes from a noisy sample."

- title: Shape Comparison and Gromov-Hausdorff Distance
  date: 2020-01-21
  place: Tulane University
  abstract: "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between any two metric spaces was first introduced by M. Gromov in the context of Riemannian manifolds. This distance measure has recently received  an increasing attention from researchers in the field of topological data analysis. In applications, shapes are modeled  as abstract metric spaces, and the Gromov-Hausdorff distance has been shown to provide a robust and natural framework for shape comparison. In this talk, we will introduce the notion and address the difficulties in computing the distance between two Euclidean point-clouds. In the light of our recent findings, we will also describe an O(n log n)-time approximation algorithm for Gromov-Hausdorff distance on the real line with an approximation factor of $5/4$."
