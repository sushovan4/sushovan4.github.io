::: {#hero-heading}
I am currently a **postdoc** fellow at the School of Information, University of California, **Berkeley**.

Find my CV [here](assets/cv.pdf).

## Education
-   **Doctor of Philosophy** in **Mathematics**   
    **Tulane University**, New Orleans, USA, 2020  
- **Master of Science** in **Mathematics**  
  **Tata Institute of Fundamental Research**, Bangalore, India, 2012  
- **Bachelor of Science**, Mathematics (Hons.)  
  **Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira**, Calcutta University, India, 2009

## Research
- **Topological data analysis (TDA)**, **applied algebraic topology**,
**computational topology**, **computational geometry**,
\textbf{road-map reconstruction} from GPS trajectory data.


My research
primarily focuses on \textbf{shape reconstruction} and \textbf{big data
  analysis}. More specifically, I am interested in solving real-world problems
using tools from \textbf{algebraic topology} and \textbf{geometry}. In order to
analyze large, complex, and noisy data, I develop provable and efficient
techniques to find and classify significant geometric and topological
features.
