::: {#hero-heading}
I am currently a postdoc reseacher and [MIDS](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/) lecturer at the School of Information, University of California, Berkeley.

Welcome to my homepage. The site showcases my [research](#research) and [software](#software-and-computing) projects, ocassional [tutorials](/tutorials/), sporadic rants, and more.

As the odds of landing on my site at random are one in 1.9 billion ([really!](https://www.internetlivestats.com/watch/websites/)), you are probably looking for something, and Google just got too generous. Nonetheless, feel free to browse, find mistakes, and leave your valuable comments.

## Research
My research primarily revolves around the interface of mathematics and computer science. More specifically, my research is motivated by theoretical problems arising in topological data analysis ([TDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis)), computational and applied topology, and computational geometry. I am also interested in solving real-life problems using tools from algebraic topology and geometry. My research interest also extends to applying TDA to other fields of science, like statistical finance and dynamical systems. 

Research Interests:  

- Topological Data Analysis  
- Computational Topology  
- Applied Algebraic Topology  
- Computational Geometry  
- Pattern and Shape Matching
- Statistical Finance

## Invited Talks and Presentations
I had been a big fan of Beamer for quite some time. Who wouldn't be when it comes to presenting slides full of math symbols? Although the math looked fancy and the audience was happy, the $\LaTeX$-based framework had also disappointed me quite often. I found the framework too restrictive to customize; my slides looked exactly like others'!

Features, that were lacking in Beamer during the time I broke up with it, were shining in RevealJS. Since then, I have been using it, customizing it, and relishing it.

## Software and Computing
I am a coding hobbyist. I enjoy solving online coding challenges. Although Java is my favorite programming language, I usually code in JavaScript and R. I develop softwares both for academia and industry. Some of them are listed here.

### Shape Reconstruction
To complement my research, I implemented my topological reconstruction algorithm for planar metric graphs in this library.  The library is written in JavaScript and made available to users as a web-app.
