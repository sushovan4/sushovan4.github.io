::: {#hero-heading}
I am currently an assistant professor of
[Data Science](https://datasci.columbian.gwu.edu/ms-data-science) at 
[GWU](https://www.gwu.edu/).

Before that, I was a visiting assistant professor at GWU. Prior to GWU, I was a postdoc researcher and 
[MIDS](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/) lecturer at the 
University of California, [Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

Welcome to my homepage. The site showcases my [research](#research) and 
[software](#software-and-computing) projects, occasional 
[tutorials](/tutorials/), sporadic rants, and more.

## Research
The theme of my research revolves around the **mathematical foundations** of data science. 
My research interests lie broadly in the following domains:

- Applied Algebraic Topology  
- Topological Data Analysis  
- Computational Geometry  
- Pattern and Shape Matching
- Statistical Finance

To know more about my research program, visit the [research](research/) page.

## Teaching
My teaching interests span a broad spectrum of fields---including foundations of data science, statistics, machine learning, computer science, topological data analysis. 
Here are some courses I have taught in recent years:  

- Introduction to statistics (*undergraduate*, Tulane University)
- Statistics for data science (*graduate*, UC Berkeley)
- Topological data analysis (*graduate*, NIT Sikkim, India)
- Data mining (*graduate*, George Washington University)
- Linear Algebra for Data Science (*graduate*, GWU)
- Algorithm design for Data Science (*graduate*, GWU)

## Software and Computing
I am a coding hobbyist. I enjoy solving online coding challenges. Although Java 
is my favorite programming language, I usually code in JavaScript, Python, and 
R. Some of them are listed here.

### Shape Reconstruction
To complement my research, I implemented my topological reconstruction algorithm
for planar metric graphs in this library.  The library is written in JavaScript 
and made available to users as a web-app.

## Invited Talks and Presentations
I had been a big fan of Beamer for quite some time. Who wouldn't be when it 
comes to presenting slides full of math symbols? Although the math looked fancy 
and the audience was happy, the $\LaTeX$-based framework had also disappointed 
me quite often. I found the framework too restrictive to customize; my slides 
looked exactly like others'!

Features, that were lacking in Beamer during the time I broke up with it, were 
shining in [Reveal JS](https://revealjs.com/). Since then, I have been using it, 
customizing it, and relishing it. Although, I prefer to edit the source code for 
my slides in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and output them in Reveal JS format.
