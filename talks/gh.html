title: Shape Comparison and Gromov-Hausdorff Distance
date: 21-01-2020
place: Tulane University
abstract: "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between any two metric spaces was first introduced by M. Gromov in the context of Riemannian manifolds. This distance measure has recently received  an increasing attention from researchers in the field of topological data analysis. In applications, shapes are modeled  as abstract metric spaces, and the Gromov-Hausdorff distance has been shown to provide a robust and natural framework for shape comparison. In this talk, we will introduce the notion and address the difficulties in computing the distance between two Euclidean point-clouds. In the light of our recent findings, we will also describe an O(n log n)-time approximation algorithm for Gromov-Hausdorff distance on the real line with an approximation factor of $5/4$."
