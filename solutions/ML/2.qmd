# 2. The PAC Learning Framework

:::{#exr-1}
Two-oracle variant of the PAC model. Assume that positive and negative examples are now drawn from two separate distributions
$D_+$ and $D_-$. For an accuracy $(1-\epsilon)$, the learning algorithm must find a hypothesis $h$ such that:
$$P_{x\sim D_+}[h(x)=0]\leq\epsilon$$ and 
$$P_{x\sim D_-}[h(x)=1]\leq\epsilon.$$
