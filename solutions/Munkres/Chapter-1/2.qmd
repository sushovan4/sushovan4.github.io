# &sect;2 Simplicial Complexes and Simplicial Maps

:::{#exr-}
Let $K$ be a simplicial complex; let $\sigma\in K$. When is $\mathrm{Int}(\sigma)$ open in $|K|$? When is $\sigma$ open in |K|$?

Show that in general, $\mathrm{St}\;v$ and $\overline{\mathrm{St}}\;v$ are path-connected.

a. Show directly that the polyhedron of Example 3 is not locally compact.

b. Show that, in general, if a complex $K$ is not locally finite, then the space $|K|$ is not locally compact.
:::

Show that the polyhedron of Example 3 is not metrizable. [Hint: Show that the first countability axiom fails.]
:::

If $g:K\to L$ is a simplicial map, carrying the vertices of $\sigma$ onto
the vertices of $\tau$, show that $\sigma$ maps some fact of $\sigma$ homeomorphically onto $\tau$.

Check that the proofs of Lemma 2.1--2.8 apply without change of complexes in $E^J$, if one simply replaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ by $E^J$.
