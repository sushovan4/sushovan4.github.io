abstract = {In the aftermath of stock market crash due to COVID-19, not all sectors recovered in the same way. Recently, a stock price model is proposed by Mahata et al. (2021) that describes V- and L-shaped recovery of the stocks and indices, but fails to simulate the U- and Swoosh-shaped recovery that arises due to sharp fall, continuation at the low price and followed by quick recovery, slow recovery for longer period, respectively. We propose a modified model by introducing a new parameter θ=+1,0,−1 to quantify investors’ positive, neutral and negative sentiments, respectively. The model explains movement of sectoral indices with positive financial anti-fragility (ϕ) showing U- and Swoosh-shaped recovery. Simulation using synthetic fund-flow with different shock lengths, ϕ, negative sentiment period and portion of fund-flow during recovery period show U- and Swoosh-shaped recovery. It shows that recovery of indices with positive ϕ becomes very weak with extended shock and negative sentiment period. Stocks with higher ϕ and fund-flow show quick recovery. Simulation of Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial and Nifty Realty show U-shaped recovery and Nifty IT shows Swoosh-shaped recovery. Simulation results are consistent with stock price movement. The estimated time-scale of shock and recovery of these indices are also consistent with the time duration of change of negative sentiment from the onset of COVID-19. We conclude that investors need to evaluate sentiment along with ϕ before investing in stock markets because negative sentiment can dampen the recovery even in financially anti-fragile stocks.}

abstract = {A geometric graph is a combinatorial graph, endowed with a geometry that is inherited from its embedding in a Euclidean space. Formulation of a meaningful measure of (dis-)similarity in both the combinatorial and geometric structures of two such geometric graphs is a challenging problem in pattern recognition. We study two notions of distance measures for geometric graphs, called the geometric edit distance (GED) and geometric graph distance (GGD). While the former is based on the idea of editing one graph to transform it into the other graph, the latter is inspired by inexact matching of the graphs. For decades, both notions have been lending themselves well as measures of similarity between attributed graphs. If used without any modification, however, they fail to provide a meaningful distance measure for geometric graphs—even cease to be a metric. We have curated their associated cost functions for the context of geometric graphs. Alongside studying the metric properties of GED and GGD, we investigate how the two notions compare. We further our understanding of the computational aspects of GGD by showing that the distance is NP-hard to compute, even if the graphs are planar and arbitrary cost coefficients are allowed. As a computationally tractable alternative, we propose in this paper the Graph Mover's Distance (GMD), which has been formulated as an instance of the earth mover's distance. The computation of the GMD between two geometric graphs with at most n vertices takes only O(n3)-time. The GMD demonstrates extremely promising empirical evidence at recognizing letter drawings.}
