	abstract = {Graph edit distance (GED) is a powerful and flexible graph matching paradigm that can be used to address different tasks in structural pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. In this paper, some new binary linear programming formulations for computing the exact GED between two graphs are proposed. A major strength of the formulations lies in their genericity since the GED can be computed between directed or undirected fully attributed graphs (i.e. with attributes on both vertices and edges). Moreover, a relaxation of the domain constraints in the formulations provides efficient lower bound approximations of the GED. A complete experimental study comparing the proposed formulations with 4 state-of-the-art algorithms for exact and approximate graph edit distances is provided. By considering both the quality of the proposed solution and the efficiency of the algorithms as performance criteria, the results show that none of the compared methods dominates the others in the Pareto sense. As a consequence, faced to a given real-world problem, a trade-off between quality and efficiency has to be chosen w.r.t. the application constraints. In this context, this paper provides a guide that can be used to choose the appropriate method.},

	abstract = {The graph edit distance (GED) is a well-established distance measure widely used in many applications. However, existing methods for the GED computation suffer from several drawbacks including oversized search space, huge memory consumption, and lots of expensive backtracking. In this paper, we present BSS GED, a novel vertex-based mapping method for the GED computation. First, we create a small search space by reducing the number of invalid and redundant mappings involved in the GED computation. Then, we utilize beam-stack search combined with two heuristics to efﬁciently compute GED, achieving a ﬂexible trade-off between available memory and expensive backtracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSS GED is highly efﬁcient for the GED computation on sparse as well as dense graphs and outperforms the state-of-the-art GED methods. In addition, we also apply BSS GED to the graph similarity search problem and the practical results conﬁrm its efﬁciency.},

In order to apply this distance measure, the graphs are characterised by descriptive graph grammars (DGG). The proposed distance measure is based on the computation of the minimum number of modifications required to transform an input graph into the reference one. Specifically, the distance measure is defined as the cost of recognition of nodes plus the number of transformations which include node insertion, node deletion, branch insertion, branch deletion, node label substitution and branch label substitution. The major difference between the proposed distance measure and the other ones is the consideration of the cost of recognition of nodes in the distance computation. In order to do this, the principal features of the nodes are described by one or several cost functions which are used to compute the similarity between the input nodes and the reference ones. Finally, an application of this distance measure to the recognition of lower case handwritten English characters is presented.},

In these cases, the graph edit distance is usually applied to deduce a distance between attributed graphs. This distance is defined as the minimum amount of edit operations (deletion, insertion and substitution of nodes and edges) needed to transform a graph into another. Since now, it has been stated that the distance properties have to be applied [(1) non-negativity (2) symmetry (3) identity and (4) triangle inequality] to the involved edit operations in the process of computing the graph edit distance to make the graph edit distance a metric. In this paper, we show that there is no need to impose the triangle inequality in each edit operation. This is an important finding since in pattern recognition applications, the classification ratio usually maximizes in the edit operation combinations (deletion, insertion and substitution of nodes and edges) that the triangle inequality is not fulfilled.},

Graph edit distance is one of the most widely accepted measures to determine similarities between graphs and has extensive applications in the fields of pattern recognition, computer vision etc. Unfortunately, the problem of graph edit distance computation is NP-Hard in general. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce three novel methods to compute the upper and lower bounds for the edit distance between two graphs in polynomial time. Applying these methods, two algorithms AppFull and AppSub are introduced to perform different kinds of graph search on graph databases. Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to examine various aspects of the methods for bounding graph edit distance. Result shows that these methods achieve good scalability in terms of both the number of graphs and the size of graphs. The effectiveness of these algorithms also confirms the usefulness of using our bounds in filtering and searching of graphs.},

A general formulation for editing graphs is used to derive a graph edit distance that is proven to be a metric, provided the cost function for individual edit operations is a metric. Then, a binary linear program is developed for computing this graph edit distance, and polynomial time methods for determining upper and lower bounds on the solution of the binary program are derived by applying solution methods for standard linear programming and the assignment problem. A recognition problem of comparing a sample input graph to a database of known prototype graphs in the context of a chemical information system is presented as an application of the new method. The costs associated with various edit operations are chosen by using a minimum normalized variance criterion applied to pairwise distances between nearest neighbors in the database of prototypes.
