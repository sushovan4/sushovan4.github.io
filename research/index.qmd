My research revolves around the interface of ***mathematics*** and ***computer science***, with a focus on the mathematical foundation of data science.
More specifically, I am interested in ***applied topology***, ***computational geometry***, and ***topological data analysis*** (TDA). 
The ***theoretical*** side of my research concerns developing inference techniques for ***data science*** that are inspired by topological and geometric methods. As a topological data analyst, I am also motivated to solve ***practical*** problems arising in various fields, like finance, physics, biology, and medicine.
