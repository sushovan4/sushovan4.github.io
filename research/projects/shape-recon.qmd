Reconstructing a geometric shape from a finite, noisy sample around it is a challenging problem, with a myriad of practical applications.
To aid the inference, I focus on a topological construction known as the Vietoris--Rips complex to thicken the sample at different scales to extract the *shape of the data* at various resolutions.
