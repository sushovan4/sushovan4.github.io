The Gromov--Hausdorff distance between two abstract metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$, denoted $d_{GH}(X,Y)$, provides a (dis)-similarity measure quantifying how far the two metric spaces are from being isometric.
In the past two decades, this distance has found applications in topological data analysis (TDA) as a theoretical framework for shape and dataset comparison, which motivated the study of its quantitative aspects.
However, precise computations of the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between even simple spaces are mostly unknown.

Although the computation of the Gromov--Hasudorff distance is generally known to be $\mathcal{NP}$-hard, it has been shown to be efficiently approximated in @majhi2023GH.

The present theme of the project lies in producing polynomial-time computatable lower bounds for the distance. In @HvsGH, we obtained novel lower bounds in case one metric space is a closed Riemannian manifold and the other is a subset thereof.

We are currently extending such lower bounds to manifolds with boundary and non-manifolds like metric graphs.
